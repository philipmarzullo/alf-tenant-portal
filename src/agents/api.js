      executiveBriefing: `EXECUTIVE BRIEFING — A&A ELEVATED FACILITY SOLUTIONS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TOP 3 PRIORITIES THIS WEEK
1. Contract renewals: 4 contracts expiring within 90 days — renewal conversations should be in progress
2. Operations: 2 VPs below 90% safety inspection target — needs management attention
3. AR Collections: 3 clients with 60+ day balances — follow up before quarter end

CROSS-DEPARTMENT RISKS
• Rising AR aging combined with upcoming contract renewals could affect retention negotiations
• Elevated incidents in one VP territory may signal staffing or training gaps
• Benefits enrollment deadlines approaching — incomplete enrollments create compliance exposure

OPPORTUNITIES
• TBI pending amounts represent immediate invoicing opportunity ($286K+ across portfolio)
• Strong compliment and good save numbers — use in QBU presentations and renewal meetings
• Glide Path shared-savings positioning for renewal discussions

RECOMMENDED EXECUTIVE ACTIONS
1. Schedule VP operations review for territories below inspection targets
2. Brief sales team on AR status before renewal meetings — ensure clean billing relationship
3. Confirm all benefits enrollments complete before deadline
4. Review TBI invoicing pipeline with finance team`,

      crossModuleAnalysis: `CROSS-MODULE ANALYSIS

Analyzing connections across departments reveals several actionable insights:

1. SALES + FINANCE: Contracts approaching renewal with outstanding AR balances should be prioritized for collection before renewal meetings begin. Clean billing relationships strengthen renewal negotiations.

2. OPS + SALES: VP performance data (inspection rates, incident counts) should be packaged for QBU presentations and renewal briefs. Strong metrics are the best retention tool.

3. HR + OPS: Union rate changes impact operational budgets. Coordinate with finance on APC adjustments for affected contracts.

4. PURCHASING + OPS: Reorder alerts for cleaning supplies could indicate increased operational demand. Cross-reference with work ticket volume.`,

1. Schedule renewal meeting ${data.daysRemaining && Number(data.daysRemaining) < 60 ? '— URGENT, less than 60 days remaining' : 'within the next 2 weeks'}
2. Prepare performance summary from AA360 data
3. Draft renewal proposal with updated pricing

RECOMMENDATION
• No pricing discussion needed at this time — variance is within expected parameters
• Document the drivers for renewal negotiation preparation
• Track TBI separately to identify scope creep vs. true extra work`,

SLIDE 1: COVER
A&A Elevated Facility Solutions
"The Performance-Focused Choice"
Prepared for: ${data.prospect || '[Prospect]'}${data.site ? ` — ${data.site}` : ''}
${data.aaTeam ? `\nPresented by: ${data.aaTeam}` : ''}
${data.presentationDate ? `Date: ${data.presentationDate}` : ''}

Presenter Notes: Open with a warm, confident introduction. Reference any prior conversations or site visits. Set the tone: "We're here to show you why performance matters more than scale."

SLIDE 2: WHY PERFORMANCE MATTERS
• 98%+ client retention rate — our clients stay because we deliver
• 99%+ SLA compliance across all accounts
• 7+ year average client relationship duration
• Cost efficiency consistently below industry benchmarks
• 53 years of continuous operations under stable leadership

Presenter Notes: This is A&A's strongest opening. Let the numbers speak. Pause after retention rate — it's our most differentiating metric. If asked about comparison to ${data.currentProvider || 'their current provider'}, stay positive: "We focus on what we deliver, not what others don't."

SLIDE 3: UNDERSTANDING YOUR NEEDS
${data.concerns ? `Key challenges identified:\n${data.concerns.split('\n').filter(Boolean).map(line => `• ${line.trim()}`).join('\n') || data.concerns}` : '[PLACEHOLDER: prospect-specific pain points]'}
${data.reasonForChange ? `\nDriver for change: ${data.reasonForChange}` : ''}
${data.specialRequirements ? `\nSpecial requirements noted:\n• ${data.specialRequirements}` : ''}

Presenter Notes: Mirror the prospect's language back to them. Show that you listened during discovery. ${data.presentingTo ? `Address ${data.presentingTo} directly by name when discussing their specific pain points.` : 'Address each stakeholder by name when discussing their specific concerns.'}

SLIDE 4: OUR APPROACH — ${(data.industry || 'YOUR INDUSTRY').toUpperCase()}
• Deep experience in ${data.industry || '[industry]'} environments — we understand the regulatory, operational, and cultural nuances
• ${data.facilityType ? `Specialized protocols for ${data.facilityType} operations` : 'Facility-specific protocols tailored to your environment'}
• Manager-heavy model ensures daily on-site accountability and oversight
• Single-point accountability across ${data.servicesRequested || 'janitorial, grounds, and MEP'}

Presenter Notes: This is where we connect A&A's capabilities to their specific environment. Reference similar clients in ${data.industry || 'their industry'} (check with sales team for approved references).

SLIDE 5: PEOPLE FIRST™ & ESOP
• Employee-owned (ESOP) — every A&A team member has a stake in your facility's success
• People First™ is our operating philosophy — employee dignity drives service quality
• SYNC task-based model: 5 specialist roles for clarity and accountability
• 25+ years managing union workforces seamlessly
${data.specialRequirements && data.specialRequirements.toLowerCase().includes('union') ? '• Direct experience with 32BJ, SEIU, and other major building service unions in the market' : ''}

Presenter Notes: People First™ is not a slogan — it's how we operate. Give a concrete example: "When our team members feel respected and valued, they take ownership of your facility. That's why our frontline retention is among the highest in the industry."

SLIDE 6: TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
• AA360 platform: QA tracking, multilingual training, AI-powered validation
• Lighthouse: real-time task completion tracking — full visibility into daily operations
• Predictive maintenance via TMA/CMMS integration
• Transparent reporting dashboards — no surprises, no black boxes
• Robotics and autonomous equipment where they improve outcomes, not replace people

Presenter Notes: Don't lead with tech — lead with what it solves. "You mentioned ${data.concerns ? 'visibility into daily operations' : 'wanting better reporting'} — here's exactly how we deliver that." Demo AA360 if possible.

SLIDE 7: PARTNERSHIP MODEL
• Glide Path shared-savings program — verified efficiency gains returned to you
• Dedicated account management team with regional VP oversight
• Regular QBU (Quarterly Business Update) presentations with actionable metrics
• Continuous improvement built into the contract structure
• Transition plan: 90-day onboarding with milestone checkpoints

Presenter Notes: Glide Path is a powerful differentiator. Frame it as aligned incentives: "We only save money when we find real efficiencies — and we share those savings with you. That's alignment you won't find with other providers."

SLIDE 8: WHY A&A
• Performance-focused, not scale-focused — we choose partnerships carefully
• 2,000+ employee-owners invested in your success
• 41 years of leadership stability under one CEO
• ${data.emphasisAreas || 'Enterprise capabilities with relationship-driven service'}
• References available from similar ${data.industry || '[industry]'} accounts

Presenter Notes: Close strong. "We're not the biggest — we're the best fit. And our 98%+ retention rate proves that our clients agree." Make eye contact with the decision maker.

SLIDE 9: NEXT STEPS
• Facility walkthrough and detailed needs assessment
• Customized scope and pricing proposal within 2 weeks of walkthrough
• Reference calls with similar ${data.industry || '[industry]'} clients
• Proposed transition timeline if we move forward together

Presenter Notes: Be specific about next steps and timelines. Offer to schedule the walkthrough before leaving the meeting. Leave behind: company overview one-pager + contact card.
